# export word document to image in high resolution

Good question under [StackExchange-word-to-image](https://superuser.com/questions/645657/export-word-document-with-high-resolution-png-to-pdf/1296204#1296204?newreg=32ce3f82d290451dbfc68760b98bbc20)


Thanks for `@Franklin Yu` answer.

> If you are using Windows 10 then you are lucky: you donâ€™t need any third party PDF printer. Windows 10 comes with a PDF printer called Microsoft PDF Printer that you can make use of. I tried and it printed with decent resolution.
