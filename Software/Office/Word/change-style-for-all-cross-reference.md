# change style for all cross-reference at one time

I was super enlighten by the answer from user `@Dennis Williamson`, for solution to change the **Style** for all **cross-reference**s, which are usually applied in Auto-caption in Word Office, in a very neat and clean one time updating.

refer: [change-style-for-cross-reference](https://superuser.com/questions/13531/is-it-possible-to-assign-a-specific-style-to-all-cross-references-in-word-2007)

Steps described in link are very detailed and informative.

The main idea is to use `find & replace` method firstly show the source codes (by pressing `Alt + F9`) for all fields, then locate all `cross-reference`s by searching `^19 REF`, finally update their styles.
