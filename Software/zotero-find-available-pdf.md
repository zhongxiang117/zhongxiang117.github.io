# Zotero find available PDF


Zotero is a great tool for literature managements.

To be more convenient, the option `Find Available PDF` can be used to automatically retrieve PDF either from OA Copies, i.g., from `Unpaywall`, or customized resolvers, like paid proxy..

Here is a way to custom PDF resolves: `Preferences -> Advance -> Config Editor`, find the setting: `extensions.zotero.findPDFs.resolvers`, then add JSON array of objects.
