# Website In a Glimpse

> it means a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.

in here, we don't extend this topic that much, instead, we focus on its most basic part, **static website**.

> for **static website**, each page is coded in `HTML` and displays the same information to every visitor who has the access to, it is in a fixed content and fixed codes.

```note
on the contrary to **static website**, it is **dynamic website**, for their differences, in summary is that **dynamic website** allows visitor interact with server, and at the same time, server will accordingly change the content to show for different visitors.
```


The most basic structure for a website is,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
</head>

<body>
  <h1></h1>
  <p></p>
  <div></div>
</body>

<script></script>

</html>
```

usually, the `<head></head>` tag is used to put `<meta>` data and `<link>`s, the `<body></body>` is used to render website contents.

Also, a well-known suggestion will always be mentioned, `<script></script>` should be placed before the end of document but after the body section, like the example showing.

Why? For the consideration of rendering speeds, especially for the website containing lots of internal and external scripts. Placing them to the last will help decrease the web responding time. Even every millisecond matters, because each more second spending on it will cause tens of thousand customers losing and leaving.


But for us, the personal webs, we don't have this issue, and we also even don't need to take it into consideration.



# Why website is so important?

It provides a convenient way to enhance communication.

Information costs money, but comparing with the method to spread out information, information itself should not be valued too much.

It is useful only when people knows it, we the people take the precedence!

Except internet, there is no other cheapest way to share information all over the world. Since the time from its starting, the webs play the vital role in internet.

therefore, we need to know how it works.


# Why is Jekyll

A tool is simply a tool, whether it's important only based on how convenient is it and how much personal emotion is paid on it.

The thing you think of weighing higher than your life, which may be dirt cheap from others viewing.

All is purely based on personal taste, however, when we make such decision, we have to consider the popularity of software and the number of supports we can get, among them, Jekyll is the best solution.

This is the Ecosystem, this is also called the platform.
