# Introduction

it spends me way too much time to figure out how to build personal website on [`github-page`](https://pages.github.com/)

one part of this reason is that I am learning those things almost totally from the scratch, which including but not limiting `ruby`, `liquid-template`,`javascript`, `jquery`, `html`, `css` and `scss`, `kramdown`, and more.

The another part is that it does NOT have **complete** documents or tutorials **step-by-step** to teach or show the way how to construct website on `github`, they are either very vague full of "argots" hard to parse and understand, or fragmented and shattered in a way spreading out everywhere on website. Be honest, this part matters a lot, which spent almost all of my time and efforts.

So I created this tutorial, in a will hoping it can shed some lights on building personal `github-page`s.

In this tutorial, I will share all of my personal experience and knowing, teaching the `newbie` like early me in a way **really-step-by-step** constructing `web-page`s.

there is no any prerequisites about how well of your `coding` abilities, I will explain every step clearly, many concepts detailedly, and the warnings and pitfalls thoroughly.

I hope I can make this tutorial better!
