thanks for the exclusive website: [http://www.lenna.org](http://www.lenna.org/)

be honest, I've used this picture over thousand times for the learning of image process, and thought it just like what it shows.

However, recently, I happened to find the behind-scene story and non-cropped image, WOW, it is amazing!

Such a great romantic case of those computer "geeks"!

*-No, not for them, I mean the Lenna's picture.*


I would like to express my gratitude to all those sharing and contributions.
