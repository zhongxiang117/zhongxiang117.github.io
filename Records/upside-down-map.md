# Upside Down Map

I have kept this link for over three years: [upside-down-map](https://www.flourish.org/upsidedownmap/)

[backup]

I still vividly remembered the day that I found it, it is a drowsy afternoon, I was waiting my simulation result which is a part on my working project, and randomly browsed on internet, and this post came into my view.

It is so shocking and brain refreshing.

I had never thought what is the "Normal" meant. 

The right is finally left. Hard to understand? It is my created phase, means, every evolution is the best fit that survives at the end.

The post subverted my outlook on life and the values from the scratch, which firstly makes me really think, what is right?

Possibly, we are talking completely two opposite things, which yet you naturally thought is the common basis.

It is not true.

Thus, gradually, I understand that the differences cast on us are the way we have been taught and our life focusing.

We are even not created equally.

However, we should not give it up respecting each other.

At least, we can do it starting from ourselves.
