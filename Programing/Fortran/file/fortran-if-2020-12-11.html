	Now that we can make some fairly complicated comparisons, we need some statements to put
them to use in a Fortran program.  The most important of these is the IF statement.  In its simplest
form a logical IF simply executes some other single statement if some logical expression evaluates to
".true.".</p><p>

</p><pre>      if (iprint.eq.1) print *, 'The value of x is ', x
      if ( x.le.5) y=0
      if( x.gt. 5) y = (x-5.)**2
</pre>
	The last two of these if statements can be combined into a more powerful block IF
,THEN, ELSE construct.<p>

</p><pre>      if ( x.le.5) then
         y=0
      else
         y=(x=5.)**2
      endif
</pre>
Note the use of indentation in this string of statements to add clarity.   Also note that the THEN 
never exists in isolation.  It always exists at the end of a statement beginning with IF, and tells
the computer to execute the following block of statements (block ended with an ELSE or
ENDIF) if the logical expression is true. <p>

	The ELSE portion is not mandatory, and more than one statement can be included in the
conditional block:</p><p>

</p><pre>      if (iprint.gt.1)   then
         print *, 'The value of x is ', x
         iprint=iprint+1
      endif
</pre>
	The IF,THEN,ELSE block structure was introduced in Fortran 77.  Before that the single
statement form of the logical IF was used.  How did we deal with the need for the more
complicated conditional code structures?  The secret was a combination of statement labels, and
the Fortran GO TO statement.  The above example might have been programmed as:<p>

</p><pre>      if (iprint.le.1)   go to 100
         print *, 'The value of x is ', x
         iprint=iprint+1
  100 z=x+3
</pre>
where the final labeled line is just the next statement in the program after the "endif" in the
previous example.  The label can be placed anywhere in columns 1 through 5, enough space to
contain numbers through 99999. As you would expect a given label number can be assigned to
only one Fortran statement in any given program unit.  Several subroutines in the same program
can all contain a label 100, because they are ignorant of the details of each other's internal
contents. Please note the change in the conditional test so that execution branches to the
statement at label 100 when iprint is less than or equal to one.   This older Fortran construct is
very close to what happens in the machine CPU conditional Branch instructions.  In archaic
Fortran, the earlier, more complex IF, THEN, ELSE example would be:<p>

</p><pre>  <a name="1"></a>    if ( x.gt.5) go to 110
         y=0
      go to 120
 110     y=(x=5.)**2
 120  continue
</pre>
The last line introduces another Fortran Statement, CONTINUE.  It is a place marker statement,
used as a target of a branch, or, as we will see later, the end of a loop.  However, CONTINUE
does not do anything itself.  I admit this is a bit of a paradox in our grand scheme of things, an
"executable statement" that actually doesn't represent the execution of any machine instruction.<p>

	If you think about the last example above, you should realize that "GO TO" can result in
very complex, unreadable code, often producing surprising results.  This problem led directly to
the IF, THEN, ELSE, and some later Fortran 90 organized structures.  It has also led to other
languages that don't even contain the direct equivalent of a "GO TO", and teachers who don't
admit its existence.</p><p>

	IF, THEN, ELSE's can be nested (one IF, THEN, ELSE contained in another.</p><p>

</p><pre>      if ( x.le.5) then
         y=0
         if( x.le.2) then
            z=0.
         else
            z=2.
         endif
      else
         y=(x=5.)**2
         z=3.
      endif
</pre>
	Note the importance of proper indentation in the above structure, to make it readable. 
This is a point where I have problems with modern structured programming emphasis on using
these structures to the exclusion of "GO TO" statements.  There comes a point where so many
lines of code exist between each IF and ELSE, and so much nesting is going on, that the code
again becomes unreadable.  There are instances where it is easier to decipher a program by doing
a pattern search on specific label numbers, than by tracking indentation.  Good programming like
life is a balancing act.<p>

	IF structures have one more level of complexity, the ELSE IF statement.</p><p>

</p><pre>      if ( x.gt.5) then
         y=100.
      else if ( x.gt.4.) then
         y=50
      else if ( x.gt.2) then
         y=25.
      else
         y=0.
      endif
</pre>
It is important to know that when the first IF is found to be true in this structure, no other IF's are
tested.  Flow branches to the ENDIF statement after completion of statements associated with the
first true IF test.  In the above example, if x is 5.5, then the resulting value of y is 100. <p>

<a name="if_a">	</a>While we are on the subject of IF's, you should be aware of one archaic form called the
arithmetic IF.  I introduce this only because some of you will be asked to improve an existing
program.  You should not use this in any new programming.  There is a good chance that it will
be dropped from some future Fortran standard.  The arithmetic IF can be recognized by the fact
that the expression within the parentheses results in a numerical result, not a logical (true, false)
result.  The other give-away is the string of three integers (statement label references) after the
right parenthesis.</p><p>

</p><pre>      if ( b**2-4*a*c) 100,200,300
  100    print *, 'Roots are Complex'
      go to 400
  200    print *, 'Single Real Root' 
      go to 400
  300    print *, 'Two Real Roots'
  400 continue
</pre>
If the arithmetic expression produces a value less than zero, execution branches to the first label
in the list.  If it is zero, control branches to the second label, and if the value is greater than zero
the program branches to the third label.  Repetition of label numbers is permitted in the IF's label
list.  Note that I must include extra "GO TO" statements to prevent execution of some of the
PRINT statements after the initial branch to another PRINT.<p>
